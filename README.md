NODE-PRINCE
===========

Because node-king is too pompous.

*****

Ever needed to write a PDF but hate almost all PDF generators out there. With this you can provide an HTTP interface to the awesome (read in not balls out hard) [PrinceXML](http://princexml.com) utility. This might be similar to other services that cost an arm and a leg, but its free. Designed for people who don't want to have to choose between forcing your server to be a 32-bit system OR paying another $3,500 (eff that).

Enjoy and do cool things with this code.
